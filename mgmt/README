This project is meant to be used as a submodule under python projects, as
the mgmt/common folder.

ex. cd $KNEWTON_REPO/lib/python/k.skeleton
    git submodule add ssh://git.knewton.net/tools/PythonInfrastructure mgmt/common

Trying to use this project in other contexts will not work by default
due to some base assumptions (see $appdir), so be aware.

.pylintrc should match up as exactly as possible with our
Python coding standards.

Jenkins "Unit Tests" jobs for Python projects should run
./mgmt/common/pylint.sh, and track the results (stored in pylint.log)
with the "Violations" Jenkins plugin.
(see https://jenkins.knewton.net/jenkins/job/lib.python.k.skeleton%20Unit%20Tests/configure
for an example)
